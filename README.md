## üîê Security Features

### API Key Protection
- TMDB API key stored in `Config.plist` (ignored by Git)
- Firebase configuration in `GoogleService-Info.plist` (ignored by Git)
- Secure key management with fallback mechanisms

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Google API Key Security
**If you received a security alert about a publicly accessible Google API key:**

1. **Immediate Action Required:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Navigate to APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
   - Find the exposed API key: `AIzaSyAzKiKsTEdsjEpZALEM5CRbHKIB_KZSGtI`
   - **DELETE or RESTRICT** this key immediately
   - Create a new API key with proper restrictions

2. **Firebase Configuration:**
   - Download a fresh `GoogleService-Info.plist` from your Firebase Console
   - Place it in the `Cannes/` directory
   - Ensure it's in `.gitignore` (already configured)
   - Never commit this file to version control

3. **API Key Restrictions:**
   - Restrict the new API key to your app's bundle ID
   - Limit to specific Firebase services only
   - Set up proper authentication methods

### Firebase Security Rules
```javascript
// Users can read/write their own data
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Rankings are readable by all authenticated users
match /users/{userId}/rankings/{movieId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Friends management
match /users/{userId}/friends/{friendId} {
  allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

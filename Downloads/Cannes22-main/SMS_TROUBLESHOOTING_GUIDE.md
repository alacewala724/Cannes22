# 🚨 SMS Not Working? Firebase Phone Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## 📱 **IMMEDIATE TESTING REQUIREMENTS**

### ⚠️ **CRITICAL: You MUST use a real iPhone device**
- Phone authentication **DOES NOT WORK** on iOS Simulator
- The enhanced debugging now throws an error if you try to use it on simulator
- Test only on your physical iPhone 14

---

## 🔧 **Step-by-Step Troubleshooting**

### **Step 1: Check Debug Output**
Run the app on your iPhone 14 and check Xcode console for these debug messages:

```
🚀 APP LAUNCH: Starting Firebase configuration...
✅ Firebase configured successfully
🔵 Firebase Project ID: cannes-fd8dc
🔵 Firebase Bundle ID: Aamir.Cannes
🔵 Firebase GCM Sender ID: 342844822343
✅ Push notification permission granted: true
🔵 Registering for remote notifications...
✅ APNs device token received: [32-character hex string]
🔧 DEBUG: Using sandbox APNs token
```

**If you see any ❌ errors here, that's your problem!**

### **Step 2: Check Phone Auth Attempt**
When you try to send SMS, look for:

```
🔵 PHONE AUTH DEBUG: Formatted phone number: +1234567890
🔵 PHONE AUTH DEBUG: Firebase App: __FIRAPP_DEFAULT
🔵 PHONE AUTH DEBUG: Auth domain: cannes-fd8dc
🔵 PHONE AUTH DEBUG: App verification disabled: true
🔵 PHONE AUTH DEBUG: Attempting to verify phone number: +1234567890
🔵 PHONE AUTH DEBUG: Starting PhoneAuthProvider.verifyPhoneNumber call...
```

**Expected Success:**
```
✅ PHONE AUTH SUCCESS: Received verification ID: [verification-id]
✅ SMS should be sent to: +1234567890
```

**Common Errors to Look For:**
```
❌ CRITICAL: App not authorized for phone authentication. Check Firebase Console APNs configuration.
❌ CRITICAL: reCAPTCHA verification failed. This often indicates APNs issues.
❌ Phone number format issue: [phone-number]
❌ SMS quota exceeded for project
❌ CRITICAL: Failed to register for remote notifications: [error]
```

## 🔥 **Firebase Console Configuration (MOST IMPORTANT)**

### **Step 3: Configure APNs in Firebase Console**

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: `cannes-fd8dc`
3. **Navigate to**: Project Settings (⚙️) → Cloud Messaging
4. **iOS App Configuration**:
   - Find your iOS app: `Aamir.Cannes`
   - Upload your **APNs Authentication Key** or **APNs Certificate**

#### **Option A: APNs Authentication Key (Recommended)**
1. Go to Apple Developer Center → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
2. Go to Keys section
3. Create a new key with "Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)" enabled
4. Download the `.p8` file
5. Upload to Firebase Console with:
   - Key ID (from Apple Developer)
   - Team ID (your developer team ID: `Y2D7KC96KS`)

#### **Option B: APNs Certificate**
1. Go to Apple Developer Center → Certificates
2. Create "Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox & Production)"
3. Download certificate and upload to Firebase

### **Step 4: Verify Firebase Configuration**
Check that your `GoogleService-Info.plist` matches:
- **Project ID**: `cannes-fd8dc`
- **Bundle ID**: `Aamir.Cannes`
- **GCM Sender ID**: `342844822343`

## 📱 **Device & App Configuration**

### **Step 5: Check Device Settings**
On your iPhone 14:
1. **Settings → Notifications → Cannes**
   - Ensure notifications are **ENABLED**
2. **Settings → Messages**
   - Check if SMS filtering is enabled
3. **Try a different phone number** for testing

### **Step 6: Check Network & Phone Service**
- Ensure strong cellular signal
- Try on WiFi + cellular
- Test with a different carrier/phone number

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: "App not authorized for phone authentication"**
**Solution**: Missing APNs configuration in Firebase Console (Step 3)

### **Issue 2: "reCAPTCHA verification failed"**
**Solution**: APNs not working properly, fix APNs configuration

### **Issue 3: "Failed to register for remote notifications"**
**Causes**:
- Running on simulator (use real device)
- Missing provisioning profile with push notification capability
- Network issues

### **Issue 4: "SMS quota exceeded"**
**Solution**: Firebase has daily SMS limits. Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Usage

### **Issue 5: Phone number format issues**
The app now formats numbers automatically:
- US: `2345678901` → `+12345678901`
- International: Use country picker
